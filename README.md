# Tabuliseâ€”An optimal schedule at UofT

An incomplete project in Python. We made this because we wanted an algorithmic way to figure out the perfect schedule at UofT minimizing the number of days at school and early mornings (cause these are bad).

Someone later told us that our problem was NP-Complete. What's that? :-)
